#a program to write text and or optionally any file to ipfs then save the hashes as a new line on a Json file. 
#then the Json file will be sent to ipfs and the hah for that is all that will be returned when the files close
#each time it saves with new data there will be a new hash so I'll store that old one as well as a time capsule. 
Basically version controller.
